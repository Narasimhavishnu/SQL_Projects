Operation Analytics and Investigating Metric Spike

PROJECT​ 
Operation Analytics is the analysis done for the complete end to end operations of a company.
With the help of this, the company then finds the areas on which it must improve upon.​
Here we work closely with the operations team, support team, marketing team, etc and help them derive insights out of the data they collect.​

JOBS REVIEWED PER DAY AND HOUR​

SELECT DS, COUNT(JOB_ ID) AS JOBS_ PER_ DAY, SUM(TIME_ SPENT)/3600 AS HOURS_ SPENT ​
FROM MS _ DATA
WHERE DS >='2020-11-01'  AND DS <='2020-11-30'  ​
GROUP BY DS ;​

CALCULATE 7 DAY ROLLING AVERAGE OF THROUGHPUT? FOR THROUGHPUT, DO YOU PREFER DAILY METRIC OR 7-DAY ROLLING AND WHY?​
THROUGHPUT MEASURES HOW MANY UNITS OF INFORMATION A SYSTEM CAN PROCESS IN A PERIOD OF TIME​


WITH CTE AS ( SELECT DS, COUNT(JOB_ID) AS NUM_JOBS, SUM(TIME_SPENT) AS TOTAL_TIME ​
FROM MS_DATA​
WHERE DS BETWEEN '2020-11-01' AND '2020-11-30' GROUP BY DS  )​
SELECT DS, ROUND(1.0*SUM(NUM_JOBS)​
OVER (ORDER BY DS ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) / SUM(TOTAL_TIME)​
OVER (ORDER BY DS ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW),2) AS THROUGHPUT_7D FROM CTE​

SHARE OF EACH LANGUAGE FOR DIFFERENT CONTENTS FOR LAST 30 DAYS.​

select sub.* ,cat*100 /8 as perentage from (SELECT language,count(*) as cat,max(ds) FROM ms_ data group by language limit 30)sub group by language;

Here I used subquery and took count of individual languages ,and find max date and limit it 30 so we get last 30 days.
now calculate the count into percentage in main query cat*100/total no of languages

DUPLICATE ROWS​

SELECT ds,job_id,actor_id,event,language,time_spent,org, COUNT(*) AS QTY​
FROM ms_data​
GROUP BY ds,job_id,actor_id,event,language,time_spent,org HAVING COUNT(*)>1;​

There are no duplicate rows in table .if we check the individual columns then we can see duplicates
.if want to show only duplicates just count he column you want to find duplicates  then use where count(*)>1 
then you can find duplicates of that particular column.​
